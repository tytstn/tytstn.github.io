*2019-03-01*

This week, I started with node and npm installation. Then, I created react app and installed recharts.
After that, I created a new file in src folder to write a new component (a chart) on the react app.

Reference: https://github.com/recharts/recharts , https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/
