## Preaparing the presentation
*2019-03-15*

This week, I mostly do prepare the information to put on the presentation.
<br>Overall, it met my goals to help developer for front-end which is generating and customizing the charts using Recharts.
<br>Lesson learned. 
- Installing and creating the React app is the challenges for me as well as generating and customizing the charts using Recharts. However, I got a help from Marcia to teach me how to create the react app and generate the charts.
