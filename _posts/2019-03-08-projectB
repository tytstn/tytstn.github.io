# Project B
## Generating a chart through Rechart for data visualization web application
## Customizing the chart
*2019-03-08*

This week, I am working on my-chart.js file to adjust the visual look for the chart which is text and colours of the charts.
I run into the issue that I can not change the colours for each section of the piechart at fist.
I did change the colours in render section which changed the colour for the whole chart. However, I could not find the tutorial for it.
I asked the developer in my team project for solving the issue so she helped me to fix it by going to const data section
after each nutrient put fill: and the colour that I would like to change for the chart.
