# Project A 
## Rendering an After Effect animation in the browser on svg, canvas and html by using bodymovin plugin
## Display an animation in the browser
*2019-02-08*

In this week, I ran into the problem for running the code through localhost 
![localhost](/images/W5-5.jpg)

In order to slove the problem, I have to add the extension on chrome call "web server" 
![webserver](/images/W5-6.jpg)

Then I type web server URL(s) that I got from the web server which is http://127.0.0.1:8887
to run the animation on the browser

Click the image to lead you to the final result.
